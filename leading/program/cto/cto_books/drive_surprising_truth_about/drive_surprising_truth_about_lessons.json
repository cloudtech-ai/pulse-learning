      "keyConcept": "Traditional motivation models, often called 'carrots and sticks,' use rewards (carrots) and punishments (sticks) to influence behavior. While effective for simple, repetitive tasks, these methods can backfire in complex, creative, or knowledge-based work. Over-reliance on external incentives may reduce intrinsic interest and engagement.",
      "example": "A company offers bonuses for meeting quarterly targets. Employees focus only on short-term goals, neglecting innovation and collaboration.",

People are more engaged when they find meaning and autonomy in their work. Modern workplaces need to adapt to these findings to foster innovation.",
      "example": "A software team given freedom to choose their tools and methods produces more innovative solutions than one micromanaged with strict incentives.",
