      "goal": "Grasp the foundational concept of systems thinking in engineering management.",
      "keyConcept": "Systems thinking is an approach to problem-solving that views organizations as interconnected systems rather than isolated parts. It emphasizes understanding how different elements interact and influence each other, often in non-obvious ways. By adopting this mindset, leaders can better anticipate unintended consequences and design more effective solutions.",
      "example": "A CTO notices that speeding up code reviews leads to more bugs in production. Instead of blaming developers, they use systems thinking to explore how review speed, team workload, and quality standards interact.",
      "practiceTip": "When facing a recurring problem, pause and map out all the related teams, processes, and feedback loops involved before jumping to a solution.",

      "keyConcept": "Feedback loops are cycles where outputs of a process are fed back as inputs, influencing future behavior. Positive feedback loops amplify changes, while negative feedback loops stabilize systems. Recognizing these loops helps leaders predict how changes will ripple through the organization.",
      "example": "A team introduces a new tool to speed up deployments. As deployments become faster, more features are shipped, increasing user feedback and leading to even more deployments\u2014a positive feedback loop.",

In engineering organizations, bottlenecks can be technical (e.g., slow build times) or organizational (e.g., decision delays). Addressing bottlenecks, rather than optimizing non-critical steps, yields the greatest improvements.",
      "example": "Despite having many developers, a team\u2019s release process is slow because only one person can approve releases, creating a bottleneck.",
