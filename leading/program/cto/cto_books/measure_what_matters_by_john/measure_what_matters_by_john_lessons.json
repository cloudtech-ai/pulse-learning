By making goals clear and measurable, OKRs drive accountability and foster a culture of transparency.",
      "example": "A CTO introduces OKRs to align the engineering, product, and design teams around a shared objective: 'Improve user engagement.' Each team sets measurable key results, such as reducing app load time or increasing daily active users.",
