      "example": "A CTO notices a developer struggling with deadlines. Instead of ignoring the issue or being harsh, the CTO expresses concern for the developer\u2019s well-being and directly discusses the missed deadlines, offering support to improve.",
      "practiceTip": "When giving feedback, ask yourself: Am I showing that I care about this person while being honest about the issue?",

      "keyConcept": "Caring personally means treating team members as individuals, not just employees. It involves showing empathy, listening actively, and supporting their growth and well-being. This creates a foundation of trust necessary for honest feedback.",
      "example": "A CTO takes time to ask a team member about their career goals and listens to their concerns about work-life balance, showing interest beyond just project outcomes.",

      "example": "A CTO who only praises but never points out mistakes may be liked but won\u2019t help the team improve. Conversely, a CTO who only criticizes can demotivate the team. Balancing both leads to better outcomes.",

The four quadrants are Radical Candor, Obnoxious Aggression, Ruinous Empathy, and Manipulative Insincerity. Recognizing these quadrants helps you understand your own feedback style and its impact on others.",
      "example": "Imagine a manager who gives blunt criticism without showing concern for the employee\u2019s feelings\u2014this is Obnoxious Aggression. In contrast, a manager who avoids tough conversations to spare feelings falls into Ruinous Empathy.",

      "example": "A CTO notices a team member struggling but avoids mentioning it to avoid hurting their feelings, resulting in continued mistakes.",

      "example": "A CTO gives vague praise to avoid a tough conversation, or criticizes someone behind their back instead of addressing the issue directly.",
