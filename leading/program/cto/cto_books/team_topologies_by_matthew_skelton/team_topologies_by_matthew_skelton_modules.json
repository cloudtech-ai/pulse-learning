  "title": "Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow",
  "description": "Team Topologies provides a practical, modern framework for structuring technology teams to optimize for fast flow and effective collaboration. The authors introduce four fundamental team types and three key team interaction modes, helping organizations design teams that align with software architecture and business needs. By emphasizing team cognitive load, boundaries, and evolution, the book empowers leaders to create organizational structures that adapt to change and promote sustained delivery performance. The approach is rooted in real-world examples and actionable guidance for continuous improvement.",
