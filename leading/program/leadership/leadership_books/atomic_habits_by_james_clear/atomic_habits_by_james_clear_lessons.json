      "goal": "Understand how habits accumulate and impact long-term growth.",
      "keyConcept": "Habits are like compound interest: small actions, repeated consistently, add up to significant results over time. Just as saving a little money regularly grows into a substantial sum, tiny positive behaviors can transform your life and leadership skills. The effects may not be immediately visible, but they become powerful when compounded.",
      "example": "A leader who spends five minutes each day giving positive feedback to team members will, over months, build a culture of trust and motivation.",
      "practiceTip": "Identify one small leadership habit you can start today, such as greeting your team each morning or asking for feedback after meetings.",

      "keyConcept": "Big transformations often start with tiny, almost unnoticeable changes. Trying to overhaul everything at once can be overwhelming and unsustainable. Instead, making small, manageable adjustments increases the likelihood of sticking with them and seeing real progress.",
      "example": "Instead of trying to become a perfect communicator overnight, a leader might start by asking one open-ended question in each meeting.",
