      "keyConcept": "Coaching is most impactful when it becomes a consistent habit, not just something you do in formal meetings. By weaving coaching into everyday interactions, you create a culture of growth and learning. This approach helps your team feel supported and encourages continuous development.",
      "example": "Instead of waiting for quarterly reviews, a manager regularly asks team members questions that help them reflect and grow during weekly check-ins.",

      "example": "When an employee brings a problem, instead of jumping in with advice, a leader asks, 'What have you already tried?' or 'What do you think is the real challenge here for you?'",
