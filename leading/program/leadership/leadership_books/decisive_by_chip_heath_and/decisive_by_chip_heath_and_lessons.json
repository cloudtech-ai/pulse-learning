      "title": "Meet the Four Villains of Decision Making",
      "goal": "Identify and describe the four common pitfalls that undermine good decisions.",
      "keyConcept": "Most poor decisions can be traced back to four key pitfalls: narrow framing (focusing too narrowly on one option), confirmation bias (seeking information that supports what we already believe), short-term emotion (letting immediate feelings cloud judgment), and overconfidence (overestimating our knowledge or ability to predict outcomes). Recognizing these villains is the first step to overcoming them.",
      "example": "A manager needs to hire a new team member and only considers internal candidates (narrow framing), seeks feedback that supports her favorite candidate (confirmation bias), feels pressured to decide quickly after a stressful meeting (short-term emotion), and assumes she can predict how the new hire will perform (overconfidence).",
      "practiceTip": "Before making your next important decision, pause and ask yourself: Am I falling into any of these four traps?",

      "title": "Widen Your Options: Avoid Narrow Framing",
      "goal": "Learn how to avoid making decisions with too few options.",
      "keyConcept": "Narrow framing occurs when we see our choices too narrowly, often as a simple 'yes or no' or 'either/or' decision. This limits creativity and can cause us to miss better alternatives. Expanding your options leads to more thoughtful and effective decisions.",
      "example": "Instead of asking, 'Should I promote Alex to team lead?', a leader asks, 'What are all the ways I could strengthen my team\u2019s leadership?'",
      "practiceTip": "When facing a decision, challenge yourself to generate at least one additional option before choosing.",

This can result in poor decisions and missed warning signs. Actively seeking out opposing viewpoints helps ensure a more balanced perspective.",
      "example": "A leader believes a new project will succeed and only asks team members who are enthusiastic about it, missing concerns from others who see potential problems.",

      "example": "After a heated disagreement, a leader feels angry and considers firing a team member on the spot. By waiting a day, she gains perspective and chooses a more constructive approach.",

      "keyConcept": "Confirmation bias is our tendency to seek out information that supports what we already believe, while ignoring or dismissing evidence that contradicts our views. This bias can lead to poor decisions because it limits our perspective and prevents us from seeing the full picture. Leaders must be vigilant in identifying when confirmation bias is influencing their thinking.",

      "goal": "Learn how to use tripwires to detect problems early and prompt timely action.",
      "keyConcept": "Tripwires are pre-set signals or checkpoints that alert you when things are going off track. They help leaders avoid drifting into trouble by making it clear when to pause, reassess, or act. Tripwires can be deadlines, budget limits, or specific performance indicators.",
      "example": "A team leader sets a rule: if sales drop below a certain number for two consecutive weeks, the team will meet to review their strategy.",

      "goal": "Understand how pre-committing to actions can help you follow through on your intentions.",
      "keyConcept": "Pre-committing means deciding in advance what you will do if certain situations arise. This reduces hesitation and helps you stick to your values or plans, even under pressure. It\u2019s a way to make good decisions easier to follow through when the moment comes.",
      "example": "A leader decides that if a project exceeds its budget by 10%, they will pause spending and hold a team review, rather than waiting until the overspend is much larger.",
      "practiceTip": "Write down one situation where you often hesitate or struggle to act, and specify in advance what you will do next time it occurs.",

      "keyConcept": "A premortem is an exercise where you imagine that your plan has failed and then work backward to determine what could have caused the failure. This helps you identify risks and weaknesses in advance, so you can address them proactively.",
      "example": "Before launching a new product, a team imagines it flopped and brainstorms all the reasons why, such as poor marketing or technical issues, then creates plans to prevent those problems.",
      "practiceTip": "Before starting a major initiative, hold a premortem with your team: ask everyone to imagine the project has failed and list possible reasons why.",

      "keyConcept": "Leaders often fall into the trap of making decisions between only two options, missing out on better alternatives. By deliberately seeking additional possibilities, you can make more informed and creative choices. Widening your options helps prevent tunnel vision and leads to better outcomes.",
      "example": "Instead of deciding whether to promote an employee or not, a manager considers other options: offering a special project, providing mentorship, or creating a new role.",

      "keyConcept": "We often make decisions based on assumptions that may not be accurate. Reality-testing involves seeking information that challenges your beliefs, such as running small experiments or asking disconfirming questions. This reduces overconfidence and helps you make more reliable choices.",
      "example": "A team leader assumes a new software will improve productivity. Instead of fully committing, she pilots it with a small group and gathers feedback before rolling it out.",
      "practiceTip": "Before finalizing a decision, ask yourself: 'What evidence would prove me wrong?' Seek out that evidence.",

      "keyConcept": "Emotions can cloud judgment and lead to impulsive decisions. By creating distance\u2014such as sleeping on it or imagining what advice you\u2019d give a friend\u2014you can make more objective choices. This helps you focus on long-term goals rather than short-term emotions.",
      "example": "A leader feels frustrated after a heated meeting and wants to reprimand a team member. Instead, she waits a day and then addresses the issue calmly.",
