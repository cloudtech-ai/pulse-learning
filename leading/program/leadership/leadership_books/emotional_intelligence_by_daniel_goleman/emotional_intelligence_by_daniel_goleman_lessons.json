      "keyConcept": "Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions, as well as to recognize, understand, and influence the emotions of others. Unlike IQ, which measures cognitive abilities, EI focuses on emotional and social skills. EI is made up of self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.",
      "example": "Imagine a manager who notices they are feeling frustrated during a team meeting. Instead of reacting impulsively, they pause, acknowledge their emotion, and choose to respond calmly.",
