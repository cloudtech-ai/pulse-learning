      "keyConcept": "Patrick Lencioni\u2019s model identifies five common dysfunctions that hinder teams: absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results. Understanding these dysfunctions helps leaders pinpoint where their teams struggle and guides targeted improvement.",
      "example": "A manager notices that team members rarely share honest feedback. By learning about the five dysfunctions, she realizes the team may lack trust, which is the foundation for addressing other issues.",

      "keyConcept": "When trust is missing, team members hide their weaknesses, avoid asking for help, and rarely admit mistakes. This leads to guarded communication, unresolved issues, and missed opportunities for collaboration.

      "example": "A manager begins a meeting by sharing a recent error in judgment and what they learned from it, inviting others to share their own experiences.",

Avoiding conflict may create a false sense of harmony, but it often leaves important issues unresolved and stifles innovation.",
      "example": "In a team meeting, everyone agrees quickly with the manager\u2019s idea, but after the meeting, several members privately express concerns. Because they avoided open disagreement, the team misses out on valuable insights.",

      "keyConcept": "Accountability is most effective when it comes from peers, not just leaders. When team members hold each other accountable, it creates a culture of mutual respect and shared responsibility. This approach reduces dependency on the leader and empowers everyone to contribute to the team's standards.",

Learning to approach accountability with empathy and clarity can make these discussions less intimidating and more productive.",
      "example": "A team member hesitates to mention a colleague's repeated tardiness, worrying it might cause tension. Instead, they frame the conversation around the team's shared goals and the impact of punctuality.",
