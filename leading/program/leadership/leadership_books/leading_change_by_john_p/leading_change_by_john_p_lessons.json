      "keyConcept": "Resistance is a natural part of any change process. Leaders can help embed change by listening to concerns, involving people in solutions, and showing how the change aligns with core values. This builds trust and commitment.",
      "example": "When employees express doubts about a new workflow, a manager holds a feedback session, listens to concerns, and adjusts the process based on input, increasing buy-in.",

      "keyConcept": "Successful change requires following a structured process without skipping critical steps. Shortcuts may seem to save time, but they often undermine the foundation needed for lasting change. Each step in Kotter\u2019s eight-step process builds momentum and commitment, making it essential to complete them in order.",
      "example": "A manager tries to implement a new software system without first building a sense of urgency or forming a guiding coalition. As a result, employees are confused and resistant, and the project stalls.",
