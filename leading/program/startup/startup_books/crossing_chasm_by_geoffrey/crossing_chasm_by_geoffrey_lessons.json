      "goal": "Recognize the five key segments in the technology adoption lifecycle.",
      "keyConcept": "The Technology Adoption Lifecycle describes how different groups of people adopt new technologies over time. The five segments are Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards. Each group has distinct motivations and risk tolerances, which impact how they respond to new products.",
      "example": "When smartphones were first introduced, tech enthusiasts (Innovators) bought them immediately, followed by trendsetters (Early Adopters). Only later did the broader public (Early and Late Majority) start using them, with some people (Laggards) waiting until smartphones were unavoidable.",
      "practiceTip": "Identify which segment your current customers belong to by asking about their openness to new technology and their reasons for trying your product.",

      "keyConcept": "The 'chasm' refers to a significant gap between Early Adopters and the Early Majority in the adoption lifecycle. Early Adopters are willing to take risks on new technology, while the Early Majority want proven solutions. Many startups struggle to cross this gap and reach mainstream customers.",
      "example": "A startup launches a new productivity app. Tech bloggers and early users love it, but mainstream office workers hesitate to try it because it seems unproven.",

Mainstream users need evidence of value, reliability, and support before adopting new technology. Without addressing these needs, startups often stall after initial success.",

They are influential within their networks and can help your product gain credibility. Unlike innovators, they look for real value and are willing to invest time and resources if they believe in your vision.",

      "example": "A mid-sized company decides to implement a new software only after seeing positive reviews and case studies from similar businesses.",

      "keyConcept": "The late majority are skeptical and adopt new technology only after it has become standard practice. Laggards are the last to adopt and may resist change unless absolutely necessary. These groups require strong proof, low risk, and often lower prices. They are less likely to be influenced by marketing and more by peer pressure or necessity.",
      "example": "A traditional business only upgrades its computers when the old ones are no longer supported, and most competitors have already switched.",
