      "goal": "Learn to recognize when feedback is polite rather than honest.",
      "keyConcept": "When you talk to friends, family, or even acquaintances about your startup idea, they often want to be supportive. This can lead them to give positive feedback that isn't truly reflective of their real interest or needs. Relying on this kind of feedback can mislead you into thinking your idea is stronger than it is.",
      "example": "You tell a friend about your new app idea, and they say, 'That sounds awesome! I'd totally use it.' But when you ask them to try a prototype, they never follow up.",
      "practiceTip": "When you receive positive feedback, follow up with a specific ask, like 'Would you be willing to pre-order or sign up for updates?' Notice if their enthusiasm turns into action.",
      "reflectionPrompt": "Have you ever received positive feedback that didn't translate into real support or action? What did you learn from that experience?",

      "goal": "Understand why vague compliments are not reliable indicators of customer interest.",
      "keyConcept": "Comments like 'That's interesting' or 'Cool idea' feel good but don't provide actionable insights. These vague compliments often mask a lack of genuine interest or need. Real customer interest is shown through specific questions, requests, or commitments.",
      "example": "A potential customer says, 'Nice concept!' but doesn't ask how it works or when it will be available.",
      "practiceTip": "After receiving a compliment, ask a follow-up question such as, 'What part of this would be most useful to you?' to gauge real interest.",

      "keyConcept": "The way you frame your questions can unintentionally lead people to give you the answers you want to hear. Leading questions or those that suggest a 'correct' answer make it hard to get honest feedback. Neutral, open-ended questions are more effective for learning the truth.",
      "example": "Instead of asking, 'Would you use an app that saves you time?' ask, 'Can you tell me about the last time you tried to save time on this task?'",

      "keyConcept": "False positives occur when you interpret polite, vague, or biased feedback as real validation. This can lead you to invest time and resources in ideas that don't have real demand. Learning to spot these signs early helps you avoid wasted effort.",
      "example": "You hear lots of 'That's great!' but no one is willing to sign up, pay, or commit to next steps.",

      "keyConcept": "When seeking feedback, it's tempting to talk about your idea and ask what people think. However, this often leads to polite lies or unhelpful compliments. Instead, focus on learning about the other person's real experiences, challenges, and behaviors. This approach uncovers genuine insights and avoids biased feedback.",
      "example": "Instead of asking, 'Would you use my new productivity app?', ask, 'Can you walk me through how you currently manage your daily tasks?'",

      "keyConcept": "People are notoriously bad at predicting their future actions, especially when asked hypothetical questions. By asking about what they've actually done in the past, you get concrete, actionable data. This helps you avoid building solutions based on wishful thinking or empty promises.",
      "example": "Instead of asking, 'Would you pay for this service?', ask, 'Have you ever paid for a similar service before? What was that experience like?'",

      "keyConcept": "Compliments and opinions feel good but rarely lead to actionable insights. Instead, dig for facts about the person's real struggles, frustrations, and workarounds. This helps you validate whether a real problem exists and if your solution is needed.",
      "example": "If someone says, 'That sounds like a great idea!', follow up with, 'Can you tell me about a time when you faced this problem?'",

      "keyConcept": "Active listening means paying close attention to what the other person says and following up to clarify or explore further. This uncovers richer insights and shows genuine interest. Simple follow-ups like 'Can you tell me more about that?' or 'Why was that challenging?' can reveal underlying motivations and pain points.",
      "example": "If someone mentions they struggle with time management, ask, 'What makes it difficult for you? Can you walk me through a recent day?'",

      "keyConcept": "Leading and yes/no questions often nudge people to agree with you or give superficial answers. These types of questions make it hard to uncover real insights because they don't encourage honest or detailed responses. Instead, focus on open-ended questions that invite people to share their true thoughts and experiences.",

      "keyConcept": "People are more reliable when talking about what they've actually done, rather than what they think they might do. By asking for specific stories or examples from their past, you get a clearer picture of their real needs and behaviors. This helps you avoid building on assumptions or wishful thinking.",
      "example": "Instead of asking, 'Would you pay for a budgeting tool?', ask, 'Tell me about the last time you paid for a tool to help with your finances. What was it and why did you choose it?'",

By focusing on learning\u2014especially about what\u2019s not working or what people struggle with\u2014you gain valuable insights that can help you build something people truly want.",

      "keyConcept": "Sharing interview findings with your team helps challenge assumptions and ensures everyone is working from the same information. Discussing real quotes and stories from customers can spark productive debates and lead to better decisions. It also prevents the team from relying on second-hand summaries or personal biases.",

      "keyConcept": "Customer interviews are only valuable if you use what you learn. When you discover new pains, needs, or behaviors, update your product, pitch, or roadmap accordingly. Iteration means making small, focused changes based on real evidence, then testing those changes in future conversations.",
      "example": "You learn that users struggle most with onboarding, so you simplify your sign-up process and test the new flow with the next batch of users.",
      "practiceTip": "After each round of interviews, identify one concrete change you can make to your product or approach, and plan how to test its impact.",

      "example": "A startup founder schedules monthly check-ins with early users to gather feedback and spot new trends before they become problems.",
      "practiceTip": "Set a recurring reminder to talk to at least one customer every week, even after you launch your product.",
